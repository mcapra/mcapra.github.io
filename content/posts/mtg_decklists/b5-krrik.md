# Introduction

Hi guys, Im KntrellCL I have been a cEDH player since 2014 and have been playing MTG since 2001. Current writer for my Chilean MTG community in Landfall Chile. I am also a member of Los Toxic Deluge, BTP SOFLO, Member of the Unified Mono Black cEDH Discord server and owner of the dedicated Krrik cedh server.

I have been working on competitive K'rrik several years, and I am proud of this powerful, unique, and innovative list.

# About K'rrik, Son of Yawgmoth

K'rrik, Son of Yawgmoth is a 4 2/2 creature with life link. It gets a +1/+1 counter each time we cast a black spell. We can pay each B mana with 2 lifes, letting us play big spell for cheaper mana.

Pros:

1. Phyrexian mana is broken
1. Phyrexian mana is BROKEN
1. Phyrexian mana is SUPER BROKEN!!
1. Gets big very fast
1. Essentially a Colorless Commander.

Cons:

1. Mono color identity
1. Life demanding
1. Draws early hate

# Why playing Midrange over Storm lists?

Having T1-T3 win ATTEMPTS doesnt mean winning the game. Midrange Krrik is not a one trick pony.

Pros:

1. Has better resiliency against Midrange Match-ups.
1. Doesnt rely on non-creature spells for winning.
1. Still capable of winning on turn 1 up to 3 oftenly.
1. Able to win through common stax pieces like Rule of Law and Null Rod.
1. Win conditions capable to dodge most of the common cEDH counterspells.

Cons:

1. Give up on Speed.

# Gameplan:

Step 1: Cast our commander.

Step 2: Keep him alive for at least one turn cycle.

If K'rrik, Son of Yawgmoth gets exiled/bounce/destroyed, repeat step 1-2 again.

Step 3: Depending on board state and opponents strategies, choose one of the following Combo Lines.

# Guideline Combos

The following combos are just guidelines on how to proceed as a start point. Get reps in the deck and start freestyling!

Most of these combos can be achieve by different routes and cards. Be creative!

# Fleshwrither Combo Line

Win through a Creature-based combo dodging most of the common counterspell and Stax pieces in the Metagame.

Fleshwrither is a Creatures-based Combo. Making the deck more consistent against Stax Pods and heavy on Blue pods.

Transfigure Fleshwrither for 1BB for Necrotic Ooze.

Transfigure Necrotic Ooze for Balthor the Defiled.

Exile Balthor the Defiled for BBB. Bring back into the Battlefield Necrotic Ooze and Fleshwrither.

Transfigure Fleshwrither for Vile Entomber. ETB entombs Razaketh, the Foulblooded.

Now, perform the next steps:

* Sacrifice Vile Entomber for Reanimate.
* Cast Reanimate targeting Vile Entomber. ETB for Skirge Familiar.
* Sacrifice Vile Entomber tutor for Asmodeus the Archfiend.
* Pitch Asmodeus the Archfiend for B with Skirge Familiar's ability through Necrotic Ooze
* Pay BBB to draw 7 cards with Necrotic Ooze using Asmodeus the Archfiend's ability.
* Discard 3 cards from your hand to produce BBB and draw 7 again.
* Repeat step 5-6 until you drew your entire deck
* **Discard Chainer, Dementia Master and recur Gray Merchant of Asphodel
* **Gain tons of lifes and sacrifice Gray Merchant of Asphodel
* **Repeat step 8-9 for the win.

** Steps 8-9-10 have been replaced by Corpse Dance. This replacement help us to gain +1 slot in the deck and also Corpse Dance overlaps with other combos in the deck with Hoarding Broodlord.

# Vilis, Broker of Blood + Sheoldred, the Apocalypse

Vilis, Broker of Blood let you draw one card for each Life point you lose.

Sheoldred, the Apocalypse gains you two Life point for each card you draw.

This combination lets you draw your entire deck meanwhile netting +1 Life point for each card drawn.

Usually Vilis, Broker of Blood will chain into Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, but you can also obtain both cards by Buried Alive both of them plus Balthor, the Defiled. Reanimate Balthor, the Defiled and get both back to combo off.

Another way to get both into play is via Fleshwrither + Entomb or any reanimation spell.
