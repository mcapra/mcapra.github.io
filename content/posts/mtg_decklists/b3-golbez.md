# Introduction

Golbez, Crystal Collector is at the helm of this deck built around generating incremental advantage, board control, and thematic artifact interactions. The deck thrives on maintaining a strong artifact presence, using creatures and planeswalkers to turn that presence into direct damage or other wins. While it contains an artifact-based combo, it is primarily a mid-range value deck, winning most often by leveraging Golbez’s abilities alongside a board full of artifacts and powerful synergies.

Expect to generate consistent advantage through artifacts, control the board, and finish opponents with Golbez-powered damage triggers.

# Gameplan

## Early Game

Always play Golbez on turn 2. Then ramp and establish a presence and start filling the graveyard.

I always keep my 0 MV artifact in hand to surveil the turn Golbez ETB. Same thing with artifact land. I'm not in a rush to fill my graveyard and look menacing with 7-8 artifacts in play and no way to fight this.

The best 3 turn play is an artifact land to surveil once and drop a 3 MV engine like Sai, Master Thopterist, Matoya, Archon Elder or Forensic Gadgeteer.

## Mid Game

Generate card advantage and control the board. You should also start to generate tokens and continue to fill the graveyard. Do not police the table, keep your counterspells for graveyard hate or artifact hate.

## Late Game

You should be able to quickly find a win con from your current board state.

# Win Conditions

Golbez is primarily a value and artifact synergy deck, and it wins by turning your artifact density into direct damage or incremental advantage. Your deck has several flexible paths to victory:

## Golbez-Powered Damage

With multiple artifacts in play, Golbez’s abilities can turn creatures into a massive burn damage. Master of Etherium, Filigree Attendant, Phyrexian Dreadnought will usually kills your opponents.

Tezzeret, Master of the Bridge can also achieve this result.

## Mechanized Production

It's quite easy to have 8 tokens with the same name. Remember, you do not need to enchant those tokens with Mechanized Production, you only need 8 with the same name.

## Artifact-Powered Combo

With Sensei's Divining Top, any artifact reducer and playing from the top of your library will allow you to draw a lot of cards and fill your graveyard. This is not an infinite combo, but you will always be able to have a full grip.
